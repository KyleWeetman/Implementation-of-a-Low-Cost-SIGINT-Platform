Abstractâ€”This capstone project creates a signal intelligence platform (SIGINT) with a low barrier to entry. The SIGINT platform is implemented using an RTL-SDR software defined radio dongle and free open source software. This platform is demonstrated through collecting automotive remote key fob signals. The key fob signals are analyzed and compared to the make and model of the cars they belong to. It is determined that remote key fob signals can be associated with their corresponding cars based on attributes of the captured signals. The privacy and security implications of this SIGINT platform are discussed.


An archive of the raw key fob signal recordings can be found [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y6SLJ-I5csqx7b-_f8FYhurPZHJWchUX/view?usp=drive_link)
